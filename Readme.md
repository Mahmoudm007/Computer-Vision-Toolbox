# VisualMinds

VisualMinds is a comprehensive repository showcasing advanced computer vision applications, all developed from scratch using C++ and the Qt framework. Each application focuses on various aspects of image processing, segmentation, and analysis, delivering robust desktop solutions.

## Applications

### 1. [CV Preprocessing Toolkit](https://github.com/Mahmoudm007/CV_preprocessing_toolkit.git)
The **CV Preprocessing Toolkit** is a robust desktop application built with C++ and Qt, designed to provide essential image preprocessing functionalities. It caters to both beginners and professionals in computer vision by offering intuitive tools for preprocessing tasks:
- **Grayscale and color image manipulation**: Convert images between color and grayscale formats, adjust brightness, contrast, and apply color filters.
- **Noise addition and removal**: Add synthetic noise (Gaussian, salt-and-pepper, etc.) to test algorithms and apply noise reduction filters such as Gaussian blur, median filters, and more.
- **Edge detection using custom algorithms**: Implement Sobel, Prewitt, and other edge detection techniques to identify image boundaries.
- **Histogram analysis, normalization, and equalization**: Visualize, modify, and enhance image histograms for better contrast and detail.
- **Color to grayscale conversion and frequency domain filtering**: Convert color images to grayscale and apply Fourier transforms for frequency-based filtering.
- **Hybrid image creation**: Merge multiple images by blending spatial and frequency components to create unique visual effects.

### 2. [Snake Contour Vision](https://github.com/Mahmoudm007/SnakeContourVision.git)
The **Snake Contour Vision** application specializes in edge detection and image segmentation using advanced methodologies:
- **Active Contour (Snakes)**: Segment objects by iteratively refining a contour to align with object boundaries. This technique is ideal for smooth and complex shapes.
- **Hough Transform**: Detect geometric shapes, such as lines, circles, or ellipses, making it useful for structural image analysis.
- **Custom edge-detection algorithms**: Beyond standard methods like Canny or Sobel, the app provides user-defined algorithms for specific edge-detection scenarios.
This tool is invaluable for projects requiring precise segmentation, such as medical imaging or object recognition.

### 3. [Feature Extraction Toolkit](https://github.com/Mahmoudm007/Image_Descriptor.git)
The **Feature Extraction Toolkit** empowers users to detect and match image features efficiently:
- **Harris corner detection and custom methods**: Pinpoint significant points in images, crucial for motion detection, object recognition, and 3D reconstruction.
- **Feature extraction and matching using robust techniques**: Utilize algorithms like SIFT and custom descriptors to extract and compare image features, ensuring robustness under scale, rotation, and lighting changes.
- **Image comparison via SSD and NCC**: Match features between images using similarity measures like Sum of Squared Differences and Normalized Cross-Correlation. These functionalities are fundamental for applications like panorama stitching, object tracking, and augmented reality.

### 4. [Segmentor](https://github.com/Mahmoudm007/Segmentor.git)
The **Segmentor** application focuses on dividing images into meaningful regions through advanced segmentation techniques:
- **Thresholding methods**: Perform optimal thresholding, Otsuâ€™s method, spectral, and local thresholding to separate objects from the background in grayscale images.
- **Unsupervised segmentation**: Use clustering techniques such as k-means and mean shift for identifying patterns in grayscale and color images.
- **Region-based segmentation**: Apply region-growing and agglomerative clustering methods for segmenting objects with shared properties.
This application is ideal for analyzing images in domains like satellite imaging, biomedical analysis, and object detection.
